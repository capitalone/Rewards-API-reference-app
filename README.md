# Capital One built this project to help the users of this API. We are no longer actively enhancing this API. We have archived the project as of Jul 23 2019 where it will be available in a read-only state. 

# Rewards API Reference Application Code


The Rewards API provides the ability to access a Capital One customer’s Rewards account balance, help them set and track to their savings goals, and enable insights to a customer’s “purchasing power” over a variety of available redemption opportunities.

## Software Requirements Including version
This is version 1.0 of the Rewards API Reference Application Code. 

## Build/Install Instructions
1. Download and install [Node]
2. Run `npm install` at the root folder to download dependencies
3. Update `config/config.js.sample` with the properties received from the developer portal and rename to `config/config.js`
3. Run `node app.js` to start the application
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
 
## Best Practices
We recommend you thoroughly review [Express Production Best Practices] for guidelines regarding Express apps. Things that are notably excluded from this reference app are:
* Database store for session cookies
* Use of TLS/HTTPS


## Roadmap
This reference app code is intended as a starting place for developers who want to use the Rewards API. As such, it will be updated with new functionality only when the Rewards API is updated with new functionality.
